## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code


### What I learned
It seems so easy to think the plan and what to do but, while implementing I have faced some confusions on where to start first and what to do next, also I learnt that implementing is different than thinking. I learnt things that are so minute yet important. I hope that further challenges will be completed  in less time.





### Continued development

More styled animations need to be added.
